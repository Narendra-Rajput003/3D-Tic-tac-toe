# üéÆ Game Mode Update - Version 2.0

## New Features Added

### 1. Game Mode Selection Screen
- Beautiful mode selection UI with gradient buttons
- Two game modes to choose from:
  - **Play with Friend** üë• - Local multiplayer
  - **Play with Computer** ü§ñ - AI opponent

### 2. AI Computer Player
- **Smart AI**: Uses Minimax algorithm for optimal moves
- **Difficulty Level**: Medium (70% smart moves, 30% random for variety)
- **Natural Behavior**: 800ms thinking delay to feel more human-like
- **Visual Feedback**: Shows "Computer Thinking..." during AI turn
- **Player Assignment**: 
  - Human plays as Sphere (üîµ)
  - Computer plays as Cube (üü•)

### 3. Enhanced Game Info Display
- Dynamic status messages based on game mode
- Shows "Your Turn" vs "Computer Thinking..." in AI mode
- Shows "You Win!" or "Computer Wins!" in AI mode
- Game mode indicator badge
- New "Change Mode" button to switch between modes

### 4. Improved User Experience
- Mode selection on startup
- Ability to change mode after game ends
- Prevents clicking during AI's turn
- Smooth transitions between modes
- Visual indication of current game mode

## Technical Implementation

### New Files Created
1. **src/components/GameModeSelector.tsx**
   - Game mode selection screen component
   - Beautiful UI with icons and animations
   - Gradient buttons for each mode

2. **src/lib/aiPlayer.ts**
   - AI player logic using Minimax algorithm
   - Difficulty levels (easy, medium, hard)
   - Smart move calculation
   - Board evaluation functions

### Modified Files
1. **src/components/GameBoard.tsx**
   - Added `gameMode` prop
   - Implemented AI move logic with useEffect
   - Added AI thinking state
   - Separated move logic into `makeMove` function
   - Restricted clicks during AI turn

2. **src/components/GameInfo.tsx**
   - Added `gameMode` and `onChangeMode` props
   - Dynamic status text based on game mode
   - Added "Change Mode" button
   - Game mode indicator badge
   - AI thinking animation

3. **src/pages/Index.tsx**
   - Added game mode state management
   - Integrated GameModeSelector component
   - Added mode selection and change handlers
   - Conditional rendering based on mode selection

## AI Algorithm

### Minimax Implementation
The AI uses the classic Minimax algorithm with the following features:
- **Optimal Play**: Calculates best possible move
- **Depth-based Scoring**: Prefers faster wins
- **Full Game Tree Search**: Evaluates all possible outcomes
- **Unbeatable on Hard**: Perfect play when difficulty is "hard"

### Difficulty Levels
- **Easy**: Random moves
- **Medium**: 70% optimal, 30% random (current default)
- **Hard**: 100% optimal (unbeatable)

## User Interface Improvements

### Mode Selection Screen
- Centered modal overlay
- Backdrop blur effect
- Gradient buttons with hover effects
- Icon animations (bounce on hover)
- Instructions and game info

### In-Game UI
- Game mode badge showing current mode
- Dynamic status messages
- Computer thinking indicator with pulse animation
- Change mode option after game ends
- Improved button layout

## Code Quality

### TypeScript
- Full type safety maintained
- Proper interfaces for all components
- Type guards for game logic

### React Best Practices
- Proper hook usage (useState, useEffect, useRef)
- Component composition
- Props drilling minimized
- Clean separation of concerns

### Performance
- AI calculation delayed to prevent UI freezing
- Efficient board state management
- Minimal re-renders
